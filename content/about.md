Hi! My name's Gina Welsh. 

I'm using this site to document my programming projects. I am very interested in natural language processing (NLP) and all things data, so you'll find projects related to that here. Feel free to browse them, and enjoy.

If you want to collaborate with me, drop me a line at gmwelsh97[at]gmail.com.
